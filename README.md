Developed an AI model for Gomoku Game using Minimax algorith and Alpha-Beta Pronning.

o human.py: This policy is human-controlled

o random.py: This policy chooses actions uniformly at random

o submission.py: Developed this using MiniMax Algorithm and Alpha, Beta proning. 


Run the below code to play against our AI :

python3 compete.py -b 15 -w 5 -x Human -o Submission

The number 15 represents the board size and 5 represents the win count, you can modify these to reduce the board and wining size.
